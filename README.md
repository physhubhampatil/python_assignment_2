**Task 1: Parity test (Even or odd)**

- Take number as input from the user
- Check  whether the number is odd or even using if-else block:
    - If number is divisible by 2 then it is even. (number % 2 == 0)
    - Else, the number is odd.
- Print the result showing whether number is odd or even.

Program for this task is available in 'parity_test.py' python file.
